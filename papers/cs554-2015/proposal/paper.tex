% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code

% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
As Many-Task Computing (MTC) is becoming commonplace on clusters, grids, and supercomputers, research that aims to take advantage of the new advances in hardware for MTC workloads becomes more relevant. A good example is the design of frameworks like GeMTC that incorporate general purpose GPU hardware to improve the concurrency of executing tasks. For this project we will attempt to support MTC workloads on the Intel Xeon Phi. Our plan is to develop two frameworks that will achieve that goal. One will be based on OpenMP and the other one on Intel’s Symmetric Communication Interface (SCIF) provided for Many-Integrated Core (MIC) accelerators like the Xeon Phi. Both frameworks will provide an identical interface to the one found in the GeMTC’s API aiming to work as drop-in replacements. Our end-goal is to present how programming many-core computing processors can be made easier and more productive using OpenMP or SCIF in integration with parallel languages like Swift/T.

\section{Background Information}
GeMTC is a CUDA based GPU framework which allows Many-Task Computing workloads to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs[1]. NVIDIA is only one manufacturer of hardware accelerators; several other brands/manufacturers include AMD GPUs and the Intel Xeon Phi. This project aims to provide support for the Intel Xeon Phi via the use of OpenMP and SCIF. The Intel Xeon Phi is a hardware coprocessor from Intel. It is a PCI device with roughly 60 cores and over 240 hardware threads. Enabling support for the Swift parallel scripting language on the Xeon Phi, through our frameworks, would contribute a great deal towards making programming many-core computing processors and accelerators easier and efficient while providing a high-level abstraction to application users.

\section{Problem Statement}
GPUs have different and restrictive programming model, but provide at least an order of magnitude better throughput for applications painstakingly coded to that model [3]. To program GPUs, typically there is a need to learn another programming language such as CUDA (NVIDIA) or OpenCL (AMD). As a result, existing vendors must spend extra time and effort to modify or rewrite parts of their codebase to take advantage of the new capabilities provided by General Purpose GPUs (GPGPUs). Besides that, barely rewriting an application just to offload computations to a GPU rarely works well. Because of the architecture of most GPUs out there, applications must be tailored from the ground up to follow the rules of the restrictive programming model of GPUs, otherwise they may suffer from severe performance penalties. Because of that, interested vendors cannot afford to go through the effort involved. Finally, while GPUs are great for massively parallel applications with thread-switching that comes almost at no cost, their performance can take a large hit when executing programs with complex logic (like complicated branching and looping for example). Therefore it may be unsuitable for certain applications of MTC.

The Intel Xeon Phi follows an alternative programming model that, although may not provide the same level of parallelism, provides more flexibility and therefore can be more suitable for certain application of MTC that GPUs are not suited for. This was the primary motivation for us to work on this project.

\section{Related Work}
The GeMTC framework and its API are limited exclusively to NVIDIA GPUs since it is developed in CUDA. Even though we will be working with OpenMP on Xeon Phi, some ideas from the CUDA version of GeMTC will still be applicable. For example using a buffer in the host’s memory that will flush tasks periodically to the device seems like a useful concept to reduce communication overhead. The actual implementation of course will have to be made from scratch since there are differences between the architecture of the Xeon Phi and the GPUs that GeMTC was initially designed for.

Moreover, there have been some preliminary results for MTC workloads on the Xeon Phi [2]. In order for these results to be acquired at that time a similar framework to GeMTC was made that used SCIF. The issue with that implementation is that it does not provide the whole feature set of GeMTC and therefore is not suitable for MTC use. Nevertheless, that initial implementation gave signs that using SCIF for direct communication between the host and the accelerator via the PCI Express bus minimized certain overheads over a similar OpenMP implementation.

\section{Proposed Solution}
The Intel Xeon Phi contains a simplified version of x86 cores, which are programmed using traditional programming languages(C, OpenMP, Pthreads) or new emerging languages (e.g. OpenCL and OpenACC) [4]. Ideally, vendors will just have to add some directives and recompile their existing software for the Xeon Phi in order to offload computation to the accelerator. The idea of having x86 cores on the accelerator implies that one can execute parallel code on it that is written for ‘normal’ computers. That also means that the Xeon Phi can handle more logically complicated programs that need to be highly parallel. Finally, under certain conditions it may be beneficial to have the whole application running natively, directly on the card [5].

Our proposed solution to the problem stated earlier is to implement two frameworks for the Xeon Phi that provide a similar interface to the GeMTC framework’s API. This way we will not only enable the support of many MTC applications of GeMTC to the Xeon Phi, but we will also be able to evaluate how well our frameworks comparing them to data from GPU applications.\\


The outline of our contributions for this project is the following:\\


\begin{itemize}
  \item Design, analyze and implement two frameworks, one in OpenMP and one in SCIF, to provide functionality identical to GeMTC and to allow MTC workloads to run on Intel Xeon Phi accelerators. The team shall attempt to duplicate GeMTC’s API for easy integration with Swift.
  \item Evaluate the performance of running concurrent homogenous and heterogeneous tasks across the Phi’s 60-core architecture (240 hardware threads) and compare it with existing the performance of existing systems.
  \item Evaluate and integrate our frameworks with Swift/T to leverage the advantages of this high-level scripting language making it a productive language for programming parallel systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}
The team will evaluate the performance of the OpenMP and SCIF implementations of GeMTC with that of the original CUDA framework. It is expected that the three versions will have different performance characteristics due to the differences in both hardware and software architecture. The evaluation will take place in a single node machine and then in multiple nodes using Swift/T. In order to make sure that our results will be helpful for real world use, we will start by testing the performance with Synthetic Sleep Workloads and from there move on to real-world MTC workloads launched by Swift/T.\\
\\*
The team plans to evaluate:
\\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How efficiency is affected between the different GeMTC frameworks depending on the different task types.
  \item How does each system behaves in terms of scalability as the number of concurrent threads increases.
  \item Model the throughput of each system, both as a function of task duration as well as thread concurrency
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, the team may perform a cursory investigation into the expected performance per watt between a GPU and Xeon Phi in a real-world supercomputing setting.

\section{Timeline with weekly goals}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
Making a framework for a device with a unique architecture like the Xeon Phi is not a common task to undertake for most software developers. Therefore, we are excited to learn about the internals of the device and see how we can get the most out of it. Nevertheless, we think the most valuable experience that we are going to get will come from considering the different tradeoffs and making decisions on a design that fits the field of Many-Task Computing.

As for the goals of our project, we would like to be realistic but also set our goals high. While it is important to implement a framework that works correctly, we think that stopping there would make our project only partially successful. We want to evaluate our success in terms of the impact of our work. Thus, we would consider our project a success if it is good enough to be presented as an alternative option to the already existing systems out there. This includes doing enough testing to verify the correctness and  the usability of our framework, while doing enough benchmarking at the same time to provide an accurate picture of where it stands when compared with existing systems in terms of performance.
